# Publishing

Since I am a little new to this, I am just putting a reminder here on how to 
publish a new release

To publish a new version to pypi

* Add a tag to a git state you wish to publish
* Browse to the github repository
* Look under the section called "About". You should see something called "Releases"
* Create a new release
* Set the tag to the one you created earlier
